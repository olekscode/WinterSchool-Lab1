This notebook is based on the examples from the Time Series Analysis and Forecasting lectures by Yarema Okhrin.

The objective is to forecast the credit score of bank clients relying on several explanatory variables.

```{r}
library(fpp)
library(GGally)
library(forecast)
library(Metrics)
library(margins)
```

### 1. Import the data and make appropriate visualisation (pairs, ggpairs)
```{r}
credit <- data(credit)
```

```{r}
pairs(credit)
ggpairs(credit)
```

### 2. Split the data randomly into training and test data set (sample)
```{r}
# Sample indexes
indexes <- sample(1:nrow(credit), size=0.2*nrow(credit))

# Split the data
credit.test <- credit[indexes,]
dim(credit.test)  # 100 8

credit.train <- credit[-indexes,]
dim(credit.train) # 400 11
```
